Description 
====
A weather dashboard that shows the current weather and a five-day forecast for a given city. It remembers the user's 10 more recently searched cities, so they can easily keep tabs on multiple areas.

To use, simply enter a city name and click search to have the weather data show on the right-hand side of the page. Alternately, click a recently searched city to show data for that city.

Demo
